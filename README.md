This is a iOS chat app that uses Bluetooth between two iOS devices to exchange keys using ECC, and then initiate a secure, symmetic chat.

Work in progress.

In order for proper function, make sure that you clone to a directory that does not have spaces in its absolute path.
This is not my bug (as far as I know), but an XCode bug, where the header search path wont work if $(SRC_ROOT) contains spaces.
